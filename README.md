# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
Program an AI that can play any n x n Tic Tac Toe game using Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficiency enhancement. The AI runs perfectly and fast for any 4 x 4 or smaller boards with the depth of searching less than 5. Yet, the AI still need to be improved and optimized for increasing winning chance as well as reducing run time. Potential methods for improvement can be using tranposition table or order moves in an optimal ways. 

You are also able to customize the game and play against your friends, family members, etc. or watch the game between two AI.
